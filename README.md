# 2D Game Project

This is our first 2D game, created by **Kaliaskarova Malika** and **Yelemanov Temirlan** using the **SFML** library.

## Getting Started

To build and run the project:
1. Copy all `.dll` files from the `SFML-2.6.1/bin` folder.
2. Paste them into your `Debug` or `Release` folder.
3. You're ready to play!

Happy gaming!
